     <h2>For Donors</h2>
     <p>Go Funding is just a technology platform. Go Funding tries to verify the information provided by campaigners to the maximum but it is impossible to be 100% accurate. Donors should make a payment only if they personally know and trust the campaigner and/or feel that the cause is genuine.
        All transactions made on Impact Guru are secure with the highest levels of SSL encryption currently available on the Internet. We ensure that our technology is up to date so that your private information is secure.
        Easily communicate with fellow donors and the fundraiser creator through comments. Keep an eye out for updates on project progress!
        Access online resources for donors at any time, through our Help Center. Our amazing customer service agents will reply to any support query within 24 hours.</p>
